## MedScout Refactor Coding Test

### Please Read All Instructions

1. We want to say that we absolutely hate tricky tests. There is nothing in this test that is "tricky". Nobody in the development world actually tries to find the cross reference of 29 chickens jumping over a building in a single bound all while drinking earl grey tea and eating twizzlers. It's just not real world programming.

2. We are not looking for a particular solution. We realize that there are 100 different ways to solve a problem and we learn from eachother every day. We do have patterns and are more interested in seeing how YOU solve the issues provided. Nobody is an island here.

3. Third and most important, DO NOT STRESS OUT TAKING THIS TEST. Not worth it nor would it be expected in this workspace.

## Getting Started

1. Create a repo with the following structure YOUR-NAME-REFACTOR if one was not provided for you. If it was disregard this step.

2. Ensure you are in YOUR repo and install

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will actually run:

```bash
"concurrently \"npm run frontend\" \"npm run backend\""
```

This will set up a backend and frontend server for you to work with.

### Requirements

I said we are not looking for a particular solution, but we are looking for aspects of that solution. Not adhering to any of these will result in rejection of your solution.

1. Use the libraries provided. There is zero need to install anything after the initial install to accomplish this task. If you install libraries just to solve a simple javascript solution this is not the place for you and we wish you all the best.

2. Code readability, structure, visually appealing (this is a front end test after all), and jest tests running (additional tests built) are all aspects we look for.
